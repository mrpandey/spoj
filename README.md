### About

- Just a collection of problems I have solved on [SPOJ](http://spoj.com).
- My spoj profile: [mrpandey](http://www.spoj.com/users/mrpandey/).
- The code is mostly in C++.
- Most of the solutions have been tested (read note below).
- Most of the solutions aren't well-commented (sorry). But some are.

**Note**: At the time of initial commit, a *few* program files were a failed attempt to solve some problem. If you spot any such incomplete or not-working code, please submit an issue.

Since initial commit, I am making sure no such file makes it to this repository.
