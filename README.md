## About

- Just a collection of problems I have solved on [SPOJ](http://spoj.com).
- My spoj profile: [mrpandey](http://www.spoj.com/users/mrpandey/).
- The code is mostly in C++.
- Most of the solutions have been tested (read note below).
- Most of the solutions aren't well-commented (sorry). But some are.

**Note**: At the time of initial commit, a *few* program files were a failed attempt to solve some problem. If you spot any such incomplete or not-working code, please submit an issue.

Since initial commit, I am making sure no such file makes it to this repository.

#### Some Unusual Solutions

I believe I have solved the following problems differently than others.

- [Adjacent Bit Counts](https://www.spoj.com/problems/GNYR09F/) | [My Solution](https://github.com/mrpandey/spoj/blob/master/solved/GNYR09F.cpp) : Common solution involves 2D dynamic programming technique with O(n^2) time ans space complexity. My solution takes O(n) time and O(1) space.
